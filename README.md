## It’s Monday, 9:07. Slack has already formed opinions.

You ask “what blew up overnight?” and the agent reads the workspace instead of you. It reconstructs the 2 AM P1 from `#incidents`—owner, resolution, and the runbook step that is still wrong. It finds the printer PIN that has been waiting in `#facilities` for five months. Then it closes the handled loops—replies, reactions, read-state changes—only where you approve.

This is not screenshot automation. The agent calls Slack through a real MCP tool surface and receives typed results it can search, summarize, export, or act on.

---

## Built past the demo

The difficult part is not another chat tool. It is the operating layer underneath: browser-session extraction that names its failure stages, a credential lifecycle built for rotation, full-fidelity reads, guarded writes, and typed workflow output. The code is plain JavaScript in this repository—audit it before trusting it with a session.

<details>
<summary><strong>The engineering underneath — extraction, credential lifecycle, reads, guarded writes, typed output</strong></summary>
<br>

### 1. The browser-session engine

`--setup` turns the Slack identity Chrome already holds into a local MCP server:

- finds the newest `xoxc-` token in Chrome's on-disk LevelDB;
- snapshots the cookie SQLite database with its WAL sidecars;
- retrieves Chrome Safe Storage from the macOS Keychain;
- runs Chrome-compatible PBKDF2 + AES-128-CBC decryption locally;
- requires no DevTools, clipboard step, browser flag, or live Slack tab;
- names the failed extraction stage—`keychain_timeout`, `no_slack_cookie_row`, `cookie_decrypt_failed`, and more—instead of returning one opaque error.

### 2. Credential lifecycle, not credential paste

Session credentials rotate. The server is built around that reality:

- `auto`, `keychain-only`, and `file` storage backends;
- owner-only token files and a Keychain-only path with no plaintext credentials on disk;
- atomic file writes, verified Keychain migration, cross-process locks, and refresh mutexes;
- proactive health checks and automatic macOS refresh;
- last-known-good in-memory credentials when persistence is temporarily unavailable;
- isolated profiles for work and personal Slack;
- fail-closed handling for invalid storage or profile configuration.

### 3. Full-fidelity Slack reads

Read DMs and channels, search the workspace, export complete histories with threads, inspect unread state, and resolve users. Opt into blocks, attachments, files, reactions, metadata, and bot/app markers when text alone is not the real message.

### 4. The agent can finish the job

Send a reply, add or remove a reaction, and mark a conversation read. Every workspace write path carries an MCP destructive annotation so compatible clients can put approval where it belongs.

### 5. Slack in, typed JSON out

Save workflow profiles for incident rooms, executive briefs, support inboxes, launch watches, and custom operations. The OSS primitives are local JSON; the optional hosted brain renders them into contract-shaped briefs.

## Two ways into Slack

Slack already knows who you are. The official path is a Slack-managed remote integration governed by workspace policy—a strong fit for organization-sanctioned deployments, documented by [Slack](https://docs.slack.dev/ai/slack-mcp-server/) with integration settings under [admin control](https://docs.slack.dev/ai/slackbot-mcp-client/admin-approval/). This project is the direct local path: session-based auth from the browser session already in Chrome, local stdio, any stdio MCP client, and no Slack app or admin request. Same Slack identity. Same underlying permissions. A radically shorter path from your workspace to your agent.

<details>
<summary><strong>Side by side: the managed integration path vs. the local session path</strong></summary>
<br>

| | Slack official MCP | **Slack MCP Server — local** |
|---|---|---|
| Starting point | A Slack-managed remote integration | The Slack session already in Chrome |
| Workspace control | Governed by workspace integration settings | **No Slack app or admin request for the local path** |
| Transport | Streamable HTTP | **Local stdio** |
| Client surface | Slack's supported partner integrations | **Any stdio MCP client** |
| Authentication | OAuth | **Existing browser session** |
| Credential lifetime | Managed OAuth | Rotating session with health checks and refresh |
| Product surface | Broad Slack-native capabilities | **21 focused tools across read, act, and automate** |
| Runtime | Slack-managed | **MIT code on your machine** |

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is the local path against Slack's terms?</strong></summary>
<br>

Treat browser-session automation as an acceptable-use decision for you and your workspace. The server acts as your signed-in Slack identity and cannot read a channel you cannot read or act as another user. It does not evade server-side retention, DLP, compliance exports, or audit controls.

"No admin request" means there is no Slack app installation to approve. It does not mean workspace activity disappears from Slack's systems. If your policy requires a sanctioned OAuth integration, use the official MCP or the optional [hosted OAuth path](https://mcp.revasserlabs.com).
</details>

## Run it with eyes open

Grid, the threat model, and cache posture — stated up front, not found later.

**Enterprise Grid.** Grid runs aggressive session-anomaly detection, and browser-session automation can trip it — flagging the session and getting it killed — independent of which tool drives it. Outbound Slack calls are paced by default to stay well under burst thresholds (`SLACK_MCP_MIN_REQUEST_INTERVAL_MS`, default 350; `SLACK_MCP_MAX_CONCURRENCY`, default 3). Even so, if your workspace runs on Grid, the session-safe path is the [hosted OAuth tier](https://mcp.revasserlabs.com) or the official Slack MCP — not this local one.

**What it touches on your machine.** `--setup` reads the newest `xoxc-` token from Chrome's on-disk LevelDB, snapshots the cookie SQLite database, retrieves Chrome Safe Storage from the macOS Keychain, and runs Chrome-compatible PBKDF2 + AES-128-CBC decryption locally. It writes only local credential state — the token file, Keychain entries, and non-secret metadata. Nothing is transmitted anywhere: the local server speaks only to Slack, as you.

Name it plainly: this is the same class of local access that Chrome App-Bound Encryption exists to make harder, and that infostealer families (Lumma, Vidar, Meduza) bypass to lift live sessions. The code path is behaviorally similar; the difference is intent and locality — you run it, on your own machine, as yourself, and it exfiltrates nothing. The source is plain JavaScript in this repository. Read it before you trust it with a session.

**Cache posture.** The only cache is a small user-name lookup: lazy, 500 entries maximum, one-hour TTL, minimised and dropped promptly. Reads happen on demand; the server keeps no persistent copy of your workspace.

---

## Install

**Node 22 or 24 recommended. Node 20 remains supported for the v4 line.**

```bash
npx -y @jtalk22/slack-mcp --setup
```

Prefer a persistent CLI: `npm install -g @jtalk22/slack-mcp` then `slack-mcp --setup`.

Then:

1. Pick your client in the [setup guide](docs/SETUP.md).
2. Register the generated stdio command.
3. Fully restart the client.
4. Ask the agent to run `slack_health_check`.
5. A workspace name in the response means the connection is live.

Use the same server command everywhere:

```json
{
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "@jtalk22/slack-mcp"]
}
```

On macOS, setup can extract from Chrome and persist the selected storage backend. On other platforms, provide `SLACK_TOKEN` and `SLACK_COOKIE` through the client's environment configuration. Docker, HTTP, and detailed client examples live in [docs/SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md) and [docs/DEPLOYMENT-MODES.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT-MODES.md).

## 21 tools: read, act, automate

The local surface ships **21 tools** today: **12 read-only** Slack operations, **4 write-path** tools that each carry an MCP destructive annotation so clients can gate workspace writes, 2 local workflow primitives, and 3 hosted-intelligence stubs that return a structured upgrade payload without making a Slack call. Four read tools accept `include_rich_message_fields: true` to surface attachments, blocks, files, reactions, and metadata—complete inputs and response contracts live in [docs/API.md](docs/API.md).

**Advertise fewer tools if the schema tax matters.** A client pays for the tool schema on every turn that carries it. `SLACK_MCP_TOOLS=essentials` advertises the six core tools — unread, history, search, thread, user lookup, send — at roughly **985 estimated tokens** of schema per turn, down from about **3,600** for all 21 (`read` sits near 2,559). `--tools=slack_x,slack_y` takes an explicit set; the default stays all 21. Filtering narrows only what's advertised — every handler stays callable — and you can reproduce the numbers with `node scripts/measure-tool-schema.js` (a ~4-chars/token estimate, stated as one).

<details>
<summary><strong>The full tool inventory</strong></summary>
<br>

### 12 read-only Slack operations

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `slack_health_check` | Verify credentials and workspace identity |
| `slack_token_status` | Inspect credential age, health, cache, profile, and storage state |
| `slack_refresh_tokens` | Refresh local credentials from the browser session on macOS—reads Slack, writes only local state |
| `slack_list_conversations` | List channels and DMs |
| `slack_conversations_history` | Read channel or DM history with optional rich fields |
| `slack_get_full_conversation` | Export complete history and threads |
| `slack_search_messages` | Search across the workspace |
| `slack_get_thread` | Read all replies in a thread |
| `slack_users_info` | Resolve a user |
| `slack_list_users` | Page through large workspace directories |
| `slack_users_search` | Search users by name, display name, or email |
| `slack_conversations_unreads` | Prioritize conversations with unread messages |

### Act in the workspace — 4 write-path tools

| Tool | Purpose | MCP safety |
|---|---|---|
| `slack_send_message` | Send to a channel or DM | destructive |
| `slack_add_reaction` | Add an emoji reaction | destructive |
| `slack_remove_reaction` | Remove an emoji reaction | destructive |
| `slack_conversations_mark` | Mark a conversation read | destructive |

### Automate locally — 2 workflow primitives

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `slack_workflow_save` | Save a typed workflow profile to `~/.slack-mcp-workflows.json` |
| `slack_workflows` | List saved workflow profiles |

### Discover hosted intelligence — 3 explicit stubs

| Tool | Hosted result |
|---|---|
| `slack_smart_search` | Semantic + lexical search over indexed Slack history |
| `slack_catch_me_up` | Structured catch-up against a saved workflow profile |
| `slack_triage` | Prioritized action queue with routing recommendations |

The OSS stubs make the hosted capability discoverable; they do not make a Slack call. `slack_refresh_tokens` only writes local credential state.

</details>

---

## Typed workflows: Slack in, JSON out

Bind a workflow kind to channels, priority people, retention, and cadence. The local profile primitives are free; hosted performs the indexed retrieval and contract-validated summarization that turn profiles into durable scheduled operations.

```bash
npx -y @jtalk22/slack-mcp --apply-template oncall-handoff --channels C012345,C067890
```

<details>
<summary><strong>Workflow contracts and shipped templates</strong></summary>
<br>

| Workflow kind | Contract |
|---|---|
| `incident_room` | `{incident_summary, timeline, open_risks, owner_gaps, next_actions}` |
| `exec_brief` | `{summary, decisions, risks, asks, action_items}` |
| `support_inbox` | `{open_threads, ack_lag, owner_gaps, escalations, next_actions}` |
| `product_launch_watch` | `{launch_signals, feedback_themes, blockers, metrics, next_actions}` |
| `custom` | `{summary, highlights, open_questions, next_actions}` |

Six editable templates ship in the package: `oncall-handoff`, `support-triage`, `exec-monday`, `sprint-tracker`, `customer-feedback`, and `incident-room`.

</details>

## Where credentials live

Resolution is deterministic; first hit wins:

1. `SLACK_TOKEN` + `SLACK_COOKIE`
2. token file (`chmod 600`)
3. macOS Keychain
4. Chrome extraction on macOS

Session credentials commonly rotate after one or two weeks. When Slack returns `invalid_auth`, `not_authed`, `token_expired`, `token_revoked`, `account_inactive`, or HTTP 401, run `npx -y @jtalk22/slack-mcp --setup` to recover locally. On macOS, `slack_refresh_tokens` or `--refresh-tokens` refreshes without leaving the client; the optional LaunchAgent in [docs/SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md) keeps long-idle installations healthy.

<details>
<summary><strong>Storage modes and multi-workspace profiles</strong></summary>
<br>

| Mode | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `auto` | Token file plus Keychain backup |
| `keychain-only` | Keychain only; verified writes and no plaintext credential file |
| `file` | Owner-only token file; Keychain is never touched |

The selected backend is remembered in non-secret metadata and used by the server, CLI, and optional refresh job. An unrecognized mode fails at startup instead of silently downgrading storage.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "slack-work": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@jtalk22/slack-mcp"],
      "env": { "SLACK_MCP_PROFILE": "work" }
    },
    "slack-personal": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@jtalk22/slack-mcp"],
      "env": { "SLACK_MCP_PROFILE": "personal" }
    }
  }
}
```

Each profile gets its own token file, Keychain entries, metadata, and lock. Add `SLACK_MCP_CHROME_PROFILE` when the workspaces live in different Chrome profiles.

## Free local when you’re driving. Hosted when it must drive itself.

When local control is enough, stop here—everything above is MIT-licensed and runs on your machine. The local product is complete, not a crippled trial: hosted earns the upgrade through continuity, intelligence, and collaboration, not by holding ordinary Slack access hostage. Hosted exists for work that must survive a rotating browser session:

- permanent OAuth;
- indexed semantic search;
- scheduled catch-up and triage;
- contract-validated workflow briefs;
- shared profiles and managed workspace continuity.

The boundary is clean. **Local mode never talks to us** — it runs on your machine and speaks only to Slack. **Hosted never sees a browser cookie** — it runs on permanent OAuth for work that must survive a rotating session (unattended schedules, Enterprise Grid). Everything above the fold is MIT-licensed and complete on its own; hosted is the paid path for continuity, not a tax on ordinary Slack access.

## Security and provenance

- Credential files are owner-only; Keychain-only mode keeps plaintext credentials off disk.
- Configuration fails closed for unknown storage modes and invalid profiles.
- Writes are atomic and shared credential state is process-locked.
- The local web server binds to localhost; workspace write tools carry destructive annotations.
- Every release publishes from CI with npm provenance.

### Provenance: don't take my word for it

```bash
npm audit signatures
```

A clean result verifies that the package signatures and attestations trace back through the published release chain. Inspect the package before handing it a live Slack session. Full policy: [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
